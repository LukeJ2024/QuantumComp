    "### **PLEASE READ ALL SECTIONS. DO NOT REMOVE ANY MARKDOWN OR CODE CELLS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will run an experiment on a quantum computer to demonstrate the violation of the CHSH inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH (or Bell) Inequality, named after the authors Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt, is used to experimentally prove Bell's theorem (1969). This theorem asserts that local hidden variable theories cannot account for some consequences of entanglement in quantum mechanics. The violation of the CHSH inequality is used to show that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. This is an important experiment for understanding the foundation of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2022 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger in part for their pioneering work in quantum information science, and in particular, for their experiments with entangled photons demonstrating violation of Bell’s inequalities.\n",

    "![Image][3]\n",

    "You can learn more about it in this [video][4]\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Create an open (free) account for [IBM Quantum Learning][1]\n",
    "* Use the [Qiskit API][2] to build and run simple circuits\n",
    "* Use quantum circuit results to justify the violation of the CHSH inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "You are expected to write your own code. It is acceptable to find and use code from the [Qiskit API][2] and [IBM Quantum Learning][1] webpages, but **it is strictly prohibited to use code obtained from other sources**, especially other students. You are also expected to write descriptive comments explaining what your code is trying to accomplish and why.\n",
